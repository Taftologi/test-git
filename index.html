<h2>My course diary of IT & Tech for women and non-binaries</h2>

The first week has passed of this introductory course of IT, and so far, we have worked on
getting familiar with Visual Studio Code, git, and Github. While everything started out interesting,
there has also been an element of frustration involved in setting up accounts. I have had an annoying
amount of problems with git and github. I imagine I am not the first person who have had some struggles with this in the beginning.
